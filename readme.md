  <b><h5>Website build: </h5></b>
     <ul> 
     <li>While building this website, I found that I was beginning
     to enjoy the process much more.  Beginning to memorize
     semantic and structural HTML was very helful.  I took
     another student's advice posted on the issues page and
     put a little sticky note with frequently used tags on
     it which greatly helped with getting familiar with them.
     I actually didn't experience any issues with the website
     build, it all went very smoothly which was a welcome
     departure from the frusturation i've felt with the last
     few assignments.</li>

    <b><h5>Wayback machine:</h5></b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using the Wayback Machine, I looked at the <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
            homepage in February of 1999.  The page looks much
            different than it dows today, but is still recognizable
            as being the same page.  Some elements such as the
            Google logo and placement of the search bar are the same
            but the use of html if much different.  For example,
            the page in 1999 used no semantic markup that I could
            find. The formatting of the present day page is
            much more aesthetially pleasing than it was in 1999.
            Overall it looks much cleaner now.

            For my second website, I chose to explore the site
            of one of my favorite visual artists, <a href="http://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/e/information/index.html">Yayoi Kusuma.</a></li>
            Aside from the dates and locations being the updated,
            and one change of photo in her biography her website
            has not really been changed since 2004.  I
            found that interesting since there is so much
            pressure in the art world to be constantly evolving,
            and this world famous artist hasn't changed any of
            the design elements of her website for over a decade.
            The html code is basically the same today as it was
            in 2004.
